    "## 4. Types of Exceptions in Python\n",
    "- There are several built-in exceptions in Python that are raised when an error occur. Some common examples of Python built-in exceptions are:\n",
    "   - **ZeroDivisionError** is raised when you perform a division by zero.\n",
    "   - **ValueError** is raised when a function or built-in operation receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "   - **NameError** is raised when the Python interpreter encounters a symbol that does not exist.\n",
    "   - **TypeError** is raised when you try performing an operation on unsupported types (e.g., 5 + 'hello').\n",
    "   - **IndexError** is raised when you try to refer a sequence which is out of range.\n",
    "   - **IOError** is raised when an IO operation fails, e.g.,  trying to open a file that do not exist.\n",
    "   - **EOFError** is raised when built-in function like input() hits an end of file condition, without reading any data.\n",
    "   - **ImportError** is raised when an import statement fails to find the module.\n",
    "   - **AssertionError** is raised when an assert statement fails (an assert statement allows you to create simple debug message outputs based on simple logical assertions).\n",
    ">- When an exception occurs the appropriate Exception class object is sent to the `except` clause, that we can receive as an argument.        ```except Exception as e: ```\n",
    ">- The Exception class object received contains additional information about the raised exception, so as to handle it accordingly."

    "1. What are exceptions in Python? When do they occur?\n",
    "2. How are exceptions different from syntax errors?\n",
    "3. What are the different types of in-built exceptions in Python? Where can you learn about them?\n",
    "4. How do you prevent the termination of a program due to an exception?\n",
    "5. What is the purpose of the `try`-`except` statements in Python?\n",
    "6. What is the syntax of the `try`-`except` statements? Give an example.\n",
    "7. What happens if an exception occurs inside a `try` block?\n",
    "8. How do you handle two different types of exceptions using `except`? Can you have multiple `except` blocks under a single `try` block?\n",
    "9. How do you create an `except` block to handle any type of exception?\n",
    "10. Illustrate the usage of `try`-`except` inside a function with an example.\n",
    "11. Differentiate between checked and unchecked exceptions\n",
    "    - **Checked Exceptions** are the exceptions which occur at compile time (e.g., file not found, no such function). Since Python is not compiled, so checked exceptions don't make much sense.\n",
    "    - **Unchecked Exception** are the exceptions which are not checked by the compiler (e.g., arithmetic exception, array out of bound). If not handled by programmer properly, the program terminate at runtime. \n",
    "12. Dig out details about User-Defined Exceptions. Python also allows you to create your own exception classes by deriving them from the standard built-in Exception class. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught. Dig out details about user-defined exceptions from this link:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions"
